## Environment Variables

A document should have been shared with you with all necessary environment variables.

## Rules

1. A PR must be reviewed by both a project owner and your weekly partner

2. Do not push to main (duh)

3. All PRs must be fully-up-to-date through rebasing before merging into main

4. Once a PR is approved, the code owner can merge themselves

5. Merge early and often, and make PRs small and digestable

6. Tag your PRs with the Issue you are working on

7. Name your branches JHID_description, ex. sye15_add_database

8. Open PRs early as drafts, then mark as ready once you are ready for review

9. Communication and clarity is KEY. Ensure your PRs all are well thought out and easy to understand and have reasonable documentation. Good communication gets you hired and keeps you valuable in the long term.
